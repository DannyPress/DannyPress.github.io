## Welcome to my Midterm Project for Fin 377

**Project description:** In this project I wanted to learn if companies in the SP500 would have high returns around when their 10ks were released. I also wanted to learn if companies that had higher sentiment analysis scores would have higher returns based of a measurement that I created. To give you a big summary of what happen, I learned alot about downloading and manipulating data in my build_sample note book with previous stock data over the year in 2022. In this note book I created a series of varaibles that are all data frames of companies cumulative stock returns that revolved around their 10k filing dates. After many loops and functions I created I was able to get all the data that I needed. I also had to do a sentiment analysis on all the companies 10ks that I downloaded and created a measurement strategy to score companies 10ks if they had a lot of positive words or negative words in their 10ks. To go more indepth I did a contextual sentiment analysis which to explain in baby terms I used a sepcific program to measure the sentiment of a sentence that was related to a topic of my choosing. The topics that I chose were ai, ESG, and DEI.
